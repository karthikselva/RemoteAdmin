A stupid deamon like code - which listens for twitter direct message through
which we can send commands so that this deamon executes it, logs it and tweets its results.


SETUP:
=====
1. First create a twitter account to which you re going to send commands as direct messages. Let me call this as gateway account
2. Make the gateway account follow your twitter account and vice versa.
3. Update the username and password of gateway account in sample_authinfo.json.
4. Update also the root password, and the id, screen name of the account from which you want to send super user commands.
5. Leave the last_exec_id as empty as it is.
6. Create a log file if neccessary and give it's path in LOG_FILE_NAME variable of twit-gateway.py
7. Rename sample_authinfo.json as authinfo.json
8. Now run twit-gateway.py! 

Please comment so that I can improve my code.
